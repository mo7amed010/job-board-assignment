### ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

- Node.js
- NestJS
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- JWT for authentication
- Class-validator for input validation

### ðŸ“Œ Assumptions Made:

- The system is admin-controlled: only admins can create/update/delete job postings.
- Each user can apply to a job once.
- Applications are linked to both the user and the job.
- The resume and cover letter are stored as text.
- Authentication is based on JWT, and role-based access is implemented manually.

### âš  Known Limitations / Areas for Improvement:

- No file upload support (resume is text only).
- No pagination or filtering on job or application listings.
- Basic error handling â€” can be enhanced with global filters and better validation responses.
- Currently lacks automated testing (unit/e2e).
- Email notifications (e.g., for application confirmation) are not implemented.
